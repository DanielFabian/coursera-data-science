First, we look at the data, without caring much about the supplement and scales.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len, colour = supp, shape = supp))
g <- g + geom_point()
g
```

it looks as though, the dose and the supplement seem to be relevant, so we look at a histogram.

```{r}
g <- ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = len, colour = supp, fill=supp))
g <- g + geom_histogram()
g <- g + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(len))
g <- g + facet_grid(dose ~ supp)
g
```
